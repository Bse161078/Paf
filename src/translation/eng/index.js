In our PAF academy language courses, we help you to acquire these language skills. Medical test: In order to work in a nursing profession in Germany, you need a certificate issued by a German doctor confirming that you are physically and mentally healthy and therefore eligible to work in a nursing profession.

This results in a difference between your gross salary negotiated in the employment contract and your paid salary, which is also referred to as the net salary. The amount of the contributions depends on your income, federal state, tax class, health insurance company and marital status.
